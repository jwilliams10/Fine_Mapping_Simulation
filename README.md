# Fine_Mapping_Simulation
Using simulated European data from "A new method for multiancestry polygenic prediction improves performance across diverse populations" Zhang et al. Nat. Genet. 2023, SNPs were extracted from chromosome 6 and 15 in Obtain_SimData.R script. These regions were extracted from Table S9 from "High-throughput characterization of functional variants highlights heterogeneity and polygenicity underlying lung cancer susceptibility" Long et al. AJHG 2024. Specifically, chromosome 6 167372978-167391392 and chromosome 15 56432339-56432339. 50 simulated responses were then created in Simulate_Data.R for each region in chromosome 6 and 15 respectively. These simulated responses were analyzed using fine-mapping methods in the Simulation_Study.R script. Lastly, the results from these methods were extracted and plotted using the Simulation_Results.R script.
